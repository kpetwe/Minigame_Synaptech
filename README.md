# Minigame_Synaptech

Purpose of Project: To test the integration of data collected on the Muse Headset with a program created in Unity.

The objective of this minigame is to remain calm. Measurements of brainwaves will be collected using the Muse Headset and recorded by the program. If the stress level is percieved to be too high, the skeleton will increase its speed when moving towards the player. The player loses if the skeleton reaches close enough to "attack" the player before X amount of time has passed. (NOTE-- WE WILL NEED TO ADD THESE CONDITIONS)

Some of these assets were not originally created by us.
